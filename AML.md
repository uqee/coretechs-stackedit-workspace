<Version>Last updated: September 16, 2021</Version>

This is the policy of Breakout Group N.V. (the Company) to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering and any activity, that facilitates money laundering, or the funding of terrorist, or criminal activities by complying with all applicable requirements and regulations, including, but not limited to the regulations of the Government of Curaçao, namely the National Ordinance Reporting Unusual Transactions, the National Ordinance Identification when Rendering Services and National Ordinance Obligations to Report Cross-Frontier Money Transportations.

Company’s AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and rules and will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls are in place to account for both changes in regulations and changes in our business.

### 1. Money Laundering

1.1. Money Laundering (ML) is the generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the "placement" stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the "layering" stage, the funds are transferred or moved into other accounts or other regulated institutions to further separate the money from its criminal origin. At the "integration" stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate businesses.

1.2. Anti-Money Laundering is a financial/legal term used to describe the legal controls that require financial institutions and other regulated entities to prevent, detect, and report ML activities.

An effective AML program requires a jurisdiction:

-   criminalization of Money Laundering;
-   granting the relevant regulators and authorities with investigation powers and instruments;
-   ensuring that financial institutions and other regulated entities identify their players, establish risk-based controls, keep records and report suspicious activities;
-   exchange of information with other jurisdictions as appropriate.

### 2. Regulation 

2.1. Employees working in the online gambling industry are required to make a report in respect of information that comes to them in the course of their business:
-   when they know;
-   when they suspect;
-   when they have reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that a person is engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing, including criminal spend.  

These obligations are collectively referred to as grounds for knowledge or suspicion. What the authorities are looking for is that we are able to demonstrate, with supporting evidence, that a risk assessment is and has been undertaken prior to entering into business relationships with players and that adequate player due diligence is conducted in order to ensure that players’ transactions are consistent with the level of risk presented.

2.2. The Company must be able to demonstrate that the extent of the ongoing monitoring undertaken is conducted on a risk-sensitive basis and that all the records are retained to reflect this, with risk profiles being properly maintained. In this document, the Company has identified additional measures that are being applied in order to carry out risk monitoring and the need of where we would require a declaration of the source of funds from players in situations which present a high risk and potentially money laundering.
