Random Number Generator (RNG).
With the exception of sports betting and live casino games, in order to ensure the integrity of the casino games, a Random Number Generator (RNG) is always used to determine the random outcome of such games. RNG used in our online casino products is administered by an external third-party suppliers and has gone through and passed external compliance testing. RNG operates at a high level of encryption and randomness to ensure fairness without exception and no human interference. RNG is a standard industry system which ensures consistently random results which has also been extensively tested by running and analyzing thousands of game rounds.
Return to Player (RTP).
The Return to Player (RTP) value is a theoretical calculation of the expected percentage of wagers that a specific game will return to player after a significant amount of plays (e.g., hundreds of million game plays). While every single game play is unpredictable and it is possible to win a big amount or lose your bet, the average return of a specific game in the long run will approach the Theoretical RTP value.
We are monitoring the players’ payout ratio on a regular basis and we cooperate with gambling regulatory authorities to ensure our compliance with the legislation of relevant jurisdictions.
