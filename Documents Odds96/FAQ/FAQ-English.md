# Account

## Why do I have to verify my Account?

Verification is required to confirm the identity of an account owner in line with standard account verification procedures. It’s also necessary when suspicious activity is detected. We will ask you to provide several photos or screenshots of certain documents at the relevant stages of the verification process. Alternatively, you can upload these documents via the ‘Verification’ page.

## How do I verify my account?

Follow these steps to verify your account:
-   Go to the ‘Verification’ page,
-   Choose the document (e.g. an ID card, passport or driving license) that you’d like to provide as your proof of identity,
-   Make sure that your file meets our formatting requirements (JPG, PNG, PDF or GIF with a maximum size of 5 Mb),
-   Upload your document.

# Deposit & Withdrawal

## How long do withdrawals take?

Most withdrawals are settled immediately. However, we process some withdrawals manually and this takes more time. For example, it may take longer to settle a withdrawal of a considerable amount. Once we have processed your withdrawal, we’ll send it to the payment provider. The time it takes to settle any transaction, of course, also depends on the provider.

## How do I make a deposit?

There are two methods that you can use in making a deposit: via a unique QR code or an e-wallet address. Let's consider a Bitcoin transaction as an example:

1.  Register with one of the most popular e-wallet services like Binance or Copay (on their websites or Android/iOS apps).
2.  Buy crypto via a bank card or any other payment methods.
3.  Go to [Odds96.com](http://odds96.com).  
4.  In the top right-hand corner, click on the wallet-like icon.
5.  In the section named "Balance", you will find your account’s address. Copy and paste it into the address book in your e-wallet to initiate the transaction. Alternatively, you can scan the QR code using your e-wallet’s mobile app.
6.  Once there is at least one confirmation on the blockchain, the Bitcoin will be credited to your account.
7.  Note that there may be some delay caused by the 3rd party services (like eWallets or exchanges) that may debit your private account but not add the transaction to the blockchain for several hours. Once your account has been topped-up, you will receive a confirmation notification.

## How can I make a withdrawal?

To withdraw your funds, please follow these steps:

1.  In the top right-hand corner, click on the wallet-like icon.
2.  In the section named "Balance", you’ll find the button "Withdraw". Click on it to proceed.
3.  Enter the sum you would like to withdraw in addition to your e-wallet address, then click on "Withdraw" again.

## I made a deposit 30 minutes ago but it hasn’t yet been credited to my account. What happened?

Your transaction is being processed. Odds96 requests a certain number of blockchain confirmations depending on the cryptocurrency you chose. For example, Bitcoin only requires one confirmation. To track the status of your deposit, you can click on the wallet-like icon and scroll down to "Transactions". Clicking on the Hash link will take you to the network page related to this transaction. Currently, we are using Blockcypher. You can check the number of blockchain confirmations in the bottom right-hand corner.

## Can I top up my account in a currency other than crypto?

We do not offer this option for the moment.

## Where can I find the information about my withdrawal and its status?

This information can be found in your account. Click on the wallet-like icon and scroll down to "Transactions".

## I’ve tried to withdraw funds but the money was returned to my account balance. What should I do?

Please contact our support team at: [support@odds96.com](mailto:support@odds96.com).

## What are the withdrawal limits?

The minimum withdrawals vary depending on the cryptocurrency you choose: BTC - 0.00036, ETH - 0.0096, USDT - 20. There is no maximum sum set for withdrawals, so you can withdraw as much as you like.

## Can I deposit Bitcoin over BEP2 or Tron network?

If you are going to deposit Bitcoin, please note that you can send them only via the Bitcoin protocol network. You cannot send Bitcoin via other protocol networks such as BEP2, BEP20, TRC-20 or ERC-20.

## Can I send ERC-20 tokens to my Ethereum deposit address on Odds96?

The Ethereum deposit address on your account has been created for receiving Ethereum coins only. Sending any other ERC-20 currency tokens to this address will result in the loss of your deposit.

## Is there a transaction fee for withdrawals?

Transaction fees vary depending on the cryptocurrency you chose: BTC - 0, ETH - 0.003, USDT - 4.

## Is there a transaction fee for deposits?

We do not charge any additional fees for making deposits, however,  blockchain networks might do so.

## Can I cancel my withdrawal?

We do not offer this option at the moment.

## I’ve already submitted my documents for the purposes of account verification but the withdrawal I requested has not yet been completed. What should I do?

Please wait until the verification process has finished.

# Betting

## What is the minimum bet?

The minimum bet varies depending on the cryptocurrency you choose: BTC - 0.00002, ETH - 0.0005, USDT - 1.

## What is the maximum bet?

Maximum bet amounts can vary based on a lot of factors, such as the type of sport, league, tournament or even the market.

## Why was my bet rejected?

Generally, there are three main reasons as to why your bet may have been rejected:

-   The stake you have placed is too high.
-   The odds have changed in the period between placing the bet and confirmation.
-   There is an issue with the automated server.

## I made a mistake while placing my bet. Can I cancel it?

Always check that your betting slip is correct before confirming. As stated in our Terms and Conditions, we can never change, modify or cancel any bet that has been confirmed by a client.

## The match has ended but my bet has not yet been settled yet. Why?

A delay can occur when our system is waiting for the verification of the match result. The delays are shorter for popular events and might be a bit longer for low-profile events.

## How is the market of cards settled when a red card has been shown to a player?

A yellow card counts as one card. A red card counts as two cards. If a player receives the second yellow card that leads to a red card, this yellow card does not count. Therefore, in this case, one player cannot receive more than three cards (1 - for the first yellow card, 2 - for the red card).

## Do you accept bets on regular time or on regular time including overtime?

We accept bets on regular time as well as on regular time including overtime. If a bet covers the whole match, we add a note in parenthesis "(incl. overtime)".

## I can’t find the event that I want to bet on. Can I somehow suggest that you add it?

Odds96 does not offer this option at the moment.

## What are the bet slip settings?

In the bet slip settings you can choose out of three options to handle odds changes:

-   Accept increases - accept only increases by default and ask for confirmation in case of a decrease,
-   Accept any changes - accept any changes by default,
-   Ask for confirmation - ask for confirmation when the odds increase or decrease.

## What are single and multiple bets?

A single bet is when you pick the outcome of one event. If your bet wins, the odds will be multiplied by your stake. A multiple bet (also known as a parlay) is a bet that depends on the outcome of more than one event. This is effectively an accumulator and you’ll need to have predicted every event correctly to get a return. If you win, your stake will be multiplied by the total odds of the selected events.

## What are the maximum odds for a parlay?

The maximum coefficient is limited by the maximum payout.

## What is the maximum number of events that I can add to a parlay?

You can add up to  20 events to a parlay.

## An event that I bet on was interrupted. How will you settle my bet?

If an event is not finalized or ‘abandoned’ after initiation (because of disqualification, interruption, refusal, changes in the results, etc), all undecided bets will be declared void. Please read our General Betting Rules for further details.

## Can you increase my maximum stake limit?

Odds96 does not offer this option at the moment.

## What event should I bet on? Give me some advice!

We do not provide any advice about betting. It must be your own choice and at your own risk.

## Asian Handicap - Quarter Lines (Х.25/Х.75)

The quarter lines refer to values ending in .25 or .75 and are a little more complex than the other handicaps. They are also called double handicaps, as they are calculated using two virtual bets and handicaps. For example, the handicap -0.25 can also be written as (0, -0.5).
