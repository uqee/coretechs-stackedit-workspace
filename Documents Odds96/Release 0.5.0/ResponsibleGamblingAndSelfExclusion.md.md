Odds96 makes all the necessary provisions for players to gamble responsibly. Odds96 is committed to preventing underage access to and irresponsible use of the games on this Website, whilst providing a supportive and fun gaming experience for its Clients. While for most Clients gambling does not cause any problems, a small percentage of Clients may be susceptible to addiction. We take this matter very seriously and suggest that all of our Clients take a short self-assessment questionnaire aimed at preventing gambling addiction.

### Responsible Gambling

Preventing gambling addiction:

1.  Are you seriously involved in gambling?
2.  Have you lost interest in your family, friends or hobbies due to gambling?
3.  Do you borrow money to gamble?
4.  Are you able to control the amount of time you spend on gambling?
5.  Is gambling having a negative effect on your reputation?
6.  Do you become irritable or aggressive when you gamble?
7.  Do you see gambling as a way to escape from your problems?
8.  After losing, do you feel the need to try to win back your losses straight away?
9.  Do you ever argue with friends or loved ones because of gambling?
10. Do you consider gambling to be a source of income?

If you have any concerns about your gambling habits, we urge you to seek for advice from the following accredited organisations:

- [begambleaware.org](https://www.begambleaware.org/)

### Responsible Gambling: Self-Exclusion

1.  In accordance with our self-exclusion policy, you can terminate your account at any time. Self-exclusion requests must be sent by email from the email address you registered with on our Website to the support team at [support@odds96.com](mailto:support@odds96.com).
2.  Upon an email request from the Client, we will offer several periods to choose from. Your account can be suspended for 1-week, 1-month, 6-months, 1-year or 2-years periods. To proceed with this process, we will require an email response where you explicitly mention the preferred duration of self-exclusion. Once we receive your confirmation, you will have 24 hours to withdraw the remaining funds.
3.  During the period of your choice the access to the account shall be totally restricted.
4.  You are not permitted to leave any balance in your account during a self-exclusion time period. You will not be able to access your account to withdraw any funds during the self-exclusion period you requested.
5.  You will lose the right to all future games, bonus funds and offers. We will not be able to recover them if the account is reactivated after the self-exclusion period expires.
6.  Once self-exclusion policy is applied to your account, it will stay in place until the requested period expires. It will not be reversed or decreased for any reason.
7.  When the self-exclusion period expires, you can ask us to restore access to your account. To do so, contact our support team at [support@odds96.com](mailto:support@odds96.com) and provide us with the detailed data about the account you would like to reactivate.
