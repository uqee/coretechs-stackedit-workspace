### General Information

1.1. There are several ways in which you may deposit and withdraw money to and from your account. These methods, in addition to the minimum and maximum deposits and withdrawals, and commission rates are shown in the list above (namedly, [Payment Methods](#payment-methods)). If the payment method you used to make a deposit doesn’t support withdrawals, please select a different one.

1.2. You may use both the desktop and mobile versions of our website to deposit and withdraw money to and from your account.

1.3. You may withdraw any amount from your account. However, the withdrawal amount cannot exceed your current account balance and the limits established by the payment system provider.

1.4. You accept and acknowledge that to withdraw funds from your account balance, you must fulfill a wagering requirement of at least 1 (one) times the deposited amount. In case this requirement is not met, we will impose limits on the amount available for withdrawal. For instance:

1. Upon depositing 100 USD, your account balance is 100 USD;
2. You bet 20 USD with odds of 3.0;
3. Your bet wins. Your account balance is now 140 USD;
4. The amount available for withdrawal now equals 60 USD. The amount you still need to wager equals 80 USD.

We reserve the right to change the wagering requirements for all users of our platform.

1.5. Odds96 is not liable for any commissions, transaction fees or lost deposits and withdrawals that may occur as a result of you entering the incorrect payment details. Odds96 reserves the right to recover any money incorrectly credited to your account and to adjust your balance to rectify any errors (for example, as the result of an accidental transaction or one that was processed in error).

1.6. In some cases, the processing time of deposits and withdrawals may be delayed and will therefore exceed expectations. Generally, this happens due to technical issues on the side of the payment system provider.

1.7. Please make sure to retain a confirmation of your transaction (for example, a confirmation email or a receipt) in case any transaction-related queries arise.

1.8. To withdraw funds, you’ll first need to verify your account. Please note that if your personal information has changed since you were last verified, Odds96 may ask for further verification before a transaction can be processed.

1.9. Following our Anti Money Laundering (AML) policy, we reserve the right to additionally check any suspicious withdrawal requests, which may take us up to 24 hours before approving or declining such a transaction. In case a suspicious withdrawal request by a Client is detected, we will ask him or her to provide identification documents.

We may ask you to provide the source of funds documentation, which is important to make sure that you provide evidence that identifies the actual source(s) of funds that you use to bet or play with.

This information may be in the form of:

- proof of earnings: Payslip/Director remuneration/Dividends/Pension;
- a bank statement/savings account that clearly shows consistent incoming values from an identifiable source;
- a Trust deed clearly showing a consistent entitlement to funds;
- dated proof of an award/payment made to the player.

1.10. Following our Anti Money Laundering (AML) policy:

- You are obliged to comply with the legal norms, including international ones, which are aimed at combating illicit trafficking, financial fraud, or money laundering.
- You agree to use your best efforts to avoid direct or indirect complicity in illegal financial activities and any other illegal transactions using the company's website.
- You guarantee the legal origin, legal ownership and legal right to use the funds transferred to the account.

1.11. If you have any problems or questions when depositing or withdrawing, please contact our support team. We are available 24/7 via live chat or email.

### Refund Policy

2.1. A refund request will only be considered if it is requested within the first twenty-four (24) hours of the alleged transaction, or within thirty (30) calendar days if a Client alleges that another individual has accessed his or her account. Each refund request should be a matter of the anti-fraud check and can be processed only in case of the positive conclusion of the anti-fraud department.

2.2. Before a refund is processed all bonuses and winnings in Client's balance will be deducted prior to calculating the amount to be refunded.

2.3. In case any сredit сard purchases are considered to carry an unacceptable risk for security or legal reasons, we will initiate refunds for all such transactions back to the сredit сard, and notify all the appropriate authorities and parties.

2.4. All costs that may occur upon the refund procedure are on the Client.
