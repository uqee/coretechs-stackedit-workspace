#### How do I change my currency preference?

For the moment, you are not allowed to change your currency preference after registering your account. But you can contact us at: [support@odds96.com](mailto:support@odds96.com) and we will try to find a solution for you.

#### Is it possible to display BTC in US dollars?

To change your currency display preference, follow these steps:

- In the upper right-hand corner, click on your ‘Account Balance’.
- In the window that appears below, you can choose the currency display option that you prefer.

Important! The exchange rate is approximate. All your bets and transactions will be settled in the currency that you have initially chosen when registering.

#### How do I make a deposit?

There are two methods that you can use in making a deposit: via a unique QR code or an e-wallet address. Let's consider a Bitcoin transaction as an example:

1.  Register with one of the most popular e-wallet services like Binance or Copay (on their websites or Android/iOS apps).
2.  Buy crypto via a bank card or any other payment methods.
3.  Go to [Odds96.com](http://odds96.com).
4.  In the top right-hand corner, click on the wallet-like icon.
5.  In the section named "Balance", you will find your account’s address. Copy and paste it into the address book in your e-wallet to initiate the transaction. Alternatively, you can scan the QR code using your e-wallet’s mobile app.
6.  Once there is at least one confirmation on the blockchain, the Bitcoin will be credited to your account.
7.  Note that there may be some delay caused by the 3rd party services (like eWallets or exchanges) that may debit your private account but not add the transaction to the blockchain for several hours. Once your account has been topped-up, you will receive a confirmation notification.

#### Is there a transaction fee for deposits?

We do not charge any additional fees for making deposits, however, blockchain networks might do so.

#### I made a deposit 30 minutes ago but it hasn’t yet been credited to my account. What happened?

Your transaction is being processed. Odds96 requests a certain number of blockchain confirmations depending on the cryptocurrency you chose. For example, Bitcoin only requires one confirmation. To track the status of your deposit, you can click on the wallet-like icon and scroll down to "Transactions". Clicking on the Hash link will take you to the network page related to this transaction. Currently, we are using Blockcypher. You can check the number of blockchain confirmations in the bottom right-hand corner.

#### Can I deposit Bitcoin over BEP2 or Tron network?

If you are going to deposit Bitcoin, please note that you can send them only via the Bitcoin protocol network. You cannot send Bitcoin via other protocol networks such as BEP2, BEP20, TRC-20 or ERC-20.

#### Can I send ERC-20 tokens to my Ethereum deposit address on Odds96?

The Ethereum deposit address on your account has been created for receiving Ethereum coins only. Sending any other ERC-20 currency tokens to this address will result in the loss of your deposit.

#### How can I make a withdrawal?

To withdraw your funds, please follow these steps:

1. In the top right-hand corner, click on the wallet-like icon.
2. In the section named "Balance", you’ll find the button "Withdraw". Click on it to proceed.
3. Enter the sum you would like to withdraw in addition to your e-wallet address, then click on "Withdraw" again.

#### Is there a transaction fee for withdrawals?

Transaction fees vary depending on the cryptocurrency you chose: BTC 0, ETH 0.003, USDT 4.

#### What are the withdrawal limits?

The minimum withdrawals vary depending on the cryptocurrency you choose: BTC 0.00036, ETH 0.01, USDT 20. There is no maximum sum set for withdrawals, so you can withdraw as much as you like.

#### How long do withdrawals take?

Most withdrawals are settled immediately. However, we process some withdrawals manually and this takes more time. For example, it may take longer to settle a withdrawal of a considerable amount. Once we have processed your withdrawal, we’ll send it to the payment provider. The time it takes to settle any transaction, of course, also depends on the provider.

#### Where can I find the information about my withdrawal and its status?

This information can be found in your account. Click on the wallet-like icon and scroll down to "Transactions".

#### I’ve tried to withdraw funds but the money was returned to my account balance. What should I do?
