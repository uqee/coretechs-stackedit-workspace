# Account

## Why do I have to verify my Account?
Verification is required to confirm the identity of an account owner in line with standard account verification procedures. It’s also necessary when suspicious activity is detected. We will ask you to provide several photos or screenshots of certain documents at the relevant stages of the verification process. Alternatively, you can upload these documents via the ‘Verification’ page.

## How long does it take to verify my account?
There are no established or standard deadlines that we need to observe when verifying your account. Usually, the duration is case-specific.
