### General Rules

- Please read these General Betting Rules carefully. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are familiar with General Betting Rules or the terms of a particular bet. Registering with Odds96 and accepting these Betting Rules will be deemed as acceptance of these rules.
- We may need to change General Betting Rules from time to time for a number of reasons. All changes will be published on the Website. The most up to date General Betting Rules will be available on the Website. A new version of General Betting Rules will come into effect after publishing on the Website.
- Your bet is placed the moment it is recorded on our system in accordance with the conditions described in these rules. On pressing 'Place Bet', a confirmation message indicates the bet has been placed. If this message does not appear, you can confirm the status of your bet by checking the bet history or by contacting our support team.
- Odds96 reserves the right to suspend any markets at any time. When a market is suspended, any bets placed on it will be rejected.
- We reserve the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (i.e. human or technical error).
- All results/scores and/or match times displayed in the list of LIVE markets are for informational purposes only. Odds96 tries to provide the most reliable information possible, but we bear no responsibility for any inaccuracies displayed on our Site.
- Multiple bets which combine different selections within the same event are not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other.
- If the venue for a sporting event is changed, all bets placed based on the original venue will be made void and stakes refunded, unless otherwise stated.
- If a match takes place at a neutral venue and this is not additionally specified, all bets will stand. If a match takes place at the home ground of the away team, all bets will be void
- A Dead Heat occurs when two or more participants are placed in the same position after the final results have been given from a specific event. For example, two winners cross the finishing line at the same time or two teams are eliminated at the same stage. If there are two winners and a dead heat is declared in any event, you will win half of your bet and lose the other half. If there are more than two winners your stake will be divided by the number of the winners of this event.
  For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for a stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided by the number of actual winners (3)) to calculate the reduced stake (100). The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus the original 300 stake).

### Cash Out

- Cash Out is available on selected events, fixtures and markets both pre-match and In-Play, on single and multiple bets, for a variety of sports.
- The Cash Out option gives you the opportunity to settle a bet at the displayed value, before the market is closed. All winnings that come from the use of the Cash Out will be automatically credited to the Client's account.
- The amount of Cash Out will depend on the performance of your selection(s) and may be higher or lower than your original stake enabling you to guarantee a profit or minimise a potential loss.
- Bonus bets are not eligible for Cash Out.
- Cash Out may not be available for some selections.
- Odds96 cannot guarantee that the Cash Out feature will be available on your bet selection.
- The Cash Out amount offered at any time is the total amount that will be returned to your account if the Cash Out request is successful.
- If you choose to Cash Out your bet, this amount will be settled and the final result relating to your bet will have no impact on the amount returned to your account.
- Cash Out is available when Cash Out Button is displayed in a bet ("My Bets" page or in "Open Bets" section of the Bet Slip).
- Should you wish to Cash Out, all you need to do is click on the Cash Out button located below your bet(s).
- In order to Cash Out, the feature must be available and show a Cash Out figure for your bet. If a price changes or a market suspends then the Cash Out request may not be successful.
- Odds96 reserves the right to remove all or part of the Cash Out feature for any Client or group of Clients where it has reasonable grounds to believe that the Client or group of Clients is misusing Cash Out by frequently using the feature to take advantage of pre-match price movements and closing their bets through the Cash Out feature before the event has started.
- Odds96 reserves the right to amend, suspend or remove the Cash Out feature (or any part of it) at any time for any event, fixture, market or Client. Any bets placed on such events, fixtures or markets will stand as originally placed.
- Odds96 reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a Cash Out if the bet or a market is settled in error.

- Where Cash Out is available pre-match and we do not cover or we stop covering the event In-Play, then Cash Out will be unavailable once the event starts or when In-Play coverage stops. Cash Out will not be available when a market is suspended.

- In the case of an incorrect settlement of markets, we reserve the right to correct them at any time.
- If a match does not adhere to the generally accepted format (e.g. unusual period length, counting procedure, format of a match etc.); we reserve the right to void any market.

#### Main Types of Bets

- **Single Bet** – This refers to a bet which is placed on a single outcome of an event. The payout for a single bet is equal to the stake amount multiplied by the odds assigned to this outcome.
- **Parlay Bet** – This refers to a bet which is placed on several independent outcomes of events. For a parlay bet to win, none of the outcomes included can lose. If one of these outcomes loses, the entire bet loses. The payout for a parlay is equal to the stake amount multiplied by the odds for all the outcomes included in this bet. If a multiple contains a selection that is being voided the odds for this selection will be set to 1, i.e. if the multiple contains the selections over 2.5 goals in game A (odds=2)_ home in game B (odds=1.5) and game B is being voided the odds for this multiple will be 2 _ 1 = 2. If a multiple contains a selection that is being settled "Half Win" the total odds are calculated as: one Win and one Half Win, odds(selection1) _ (odds (selection2)/2 + 1/2). If a multiple contains a selection that is being settled “Half Lose” the total odds are calculated as: i.e. one Win and one Half Lose, odds(selection1) _ 1/2.
- **PRE-MATCH bets** – This refers to bets on a sporting event which are accepted before it starts.
- **LIVE bets** – This refers to bets on a sporting event which are accepted while a game is happening on outcomes which have not yet been determined.

#### Outrights

We offer outright bets on leagues, groups, players and competitions concerning the finish position, stage of elimination or ranking of teams and players. They will be settled at the end of the scheduled programme of matches or competitions. We offer some types of outrights and here is a short description:

- Championship - predict the result of a competitor in the whole championship.
- Short Term - predict the result of a competitor in one of the stages of a championship.
- Top X - predict if a competitor ranks among the Top X.
- Head to Head - predict which competititor's position in the resulting table will be higher.

Examples of the outrights:

- English Premier League - Winner
- English Premier League - Top X (Top-2, Top-4, Top-6)
- English Premier League - w/o The Big Six
- English Premier League - To finish bottom
- English Premier League - Team to score least goals
- England Premier League - Top London club
- NHL - Stanley Cup Winner
- NHL - Division Winner
- NHL - Hart Memorial Trophy (reg.season)
- NBA - Winner

- American Football - Superbowl Winner
- American Football - Conference Winner
- American Football - Division Winner
- Baseball - Worls Series Winner
- Baseball - National (American) League Winner
- Volleyball - Italian Superlega Winner

All outright bets regarding team’s or players’ statistics such as goals, corners, yellow and red cards are settled taking into account extra time in play-off matches. The goals scored in a penalty shootout do not count.

Unless otherwise stated, outright markets are considered All-in Run or Not, therefore bets will stand on any team which does not complete all of its fixtures and either retires or forfeits the competition.

Outright markets are considered All-in Run or Not and therefore will be settled as a loss if the selection does not take part in the event.

Dead heat rule applies when outright bet is settled.

##### Dead Heat Rule

A Dead Heat occurs when two or more competitors are placed in the same position after the final results have been given from a specific event. For example, two winners cross the finishing line at the same time or two teams are eliminated at the same stage. If there are two winners and a dead heat is declared in any event, you will win half of your bet and lose the other half. If there are more than two winners your stake will be divided by the number of the winners of this event.

##### Head to Head bets

We offer Head to Head bets on teams and other competitors concerning the finishing position, stage of elimination or ranking of teams and players. You need to predict which competitor will achieve the highest finishing position. All competitors must participate in the event for bets to stand. If there is no winner your stake will be void.

#### Main Betting Markets

- **1X2**. This refers to bets on the final result of a match. 1 = Team 1 wins, X = a draw, 2 = Team 2 wins.
- **Handicap**. This refers to the advantage or disadvantage assigned to a competitor by Odds96 for any bets placed on them. Handicaps are expressed in goals/points/sets/seconds, etc. When settling handicap bets, the handicap assigned to a competitor is added to the total number of points/goals/games, etc. If the competitor wins after the handicap has been applied, handicap bets placed on them win. If not, bets lose. In the event of a tie, bets will be void (settled at odds of 1.00).
- **Total.** This refers to bets placed on the total number of goals, points, games, etc., scored/ played by teams or players. In order to win, you need to predict whether the number of goals/points scored or games played will be higher/lower than the designated value of the total. For bet settlement purposes, only goals scored in the opponent’s goal count towards “individual” totals (Total bets on one team or player). If the outcome is equal to the designated value of the total offered by Odds96, bets will be void.
- **European Handicap 1X2.** With European handicap, the match, for the purposes of this bet, starts with a designated score, which is indicated in the handicap value. The final outcome of such bets is calculated by adding the handicap value to the match score. European handicap bets cannot be partially or fully refunded;the player either wins or loses their bet in full. For a European handicap bet to win, a match has to end in a victory for the team chosen by the player after the handicap has been applied or in a draw if a “Draw” outcome has been selected.
- **“0" Handicap (Draw No Bet).** If either team wins, all bets on such an outcome win. In the event of a tie, all bets will be void.
- **Half-Time/Full-Time.** This refers to bets placed on the outcomes of the first half and the match. For such bets, the first half outcome is shown first and is followed by the outcome of the match. The outcome of the second half or other periods is not taken into account when settling bets. For example, W1W2 means that Team 1 will win (W1) the first half and Team 2 will win (W2) the match.
- **Double Chance.** This refers to bets on the final result of a match which only require one of the two selected outcomes to occur to win. For example, if a bet is placed on a “1X” outcome, bets will win if Team 1 wins or the match ends in a draw.
- **Correct Score.** This refers to bets where you need to predict the final score of a match.
- **Even/Odd.** This refers to bets on whether the total number of goals, points or sets will be even or odd.
- **Race to X Points**. This refers to bets on who will be the first to score X points in a match.

#### Settled Outcomes

There are five different settled outcomes being used: Win, Lose, Return, Half win and Half lose. Half win and Half lose refers to Asian handicap or Over/Under where the line includes a quarter (0.25, 0.75, 1.25 etc.).

If a bet is placed on over 2.25, half of the stake is placed on over 2 and half of the stake is placed on over 2.5. If the game ends with exactly two goals (1-1, 2-0 or 0-2) the bet placed on over 2 is settled tie and the bet placed on over 2.5 is settled lose. This is called Half lose. If the game ends with more than two goals the bet is settled win or if it ends with less than two goals the bet is settled lose.

If a bet is placed on over 2.75, half of the stake is placed on over 2.5 and half of the stake is placed on over 3. If the game ends with exactly three goals (2-1, 3-0, 1-2 or 0-3) the bet placed on over 2.5 is settled as win and the bet placed on over 3 is settled tie. This is called Half win. If the game ends with more than three goals the bet is settled win or if it ends with less than three goals the bet is settled lose.

If the wagering offer on an event includes a draw as a third option and the event ends in a draw, wagers on the draw will be paid, while wagers on either side will be lost.
