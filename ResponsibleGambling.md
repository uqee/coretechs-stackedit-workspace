Odds96 makes all the necessary provisions for players to gamble responsibly. Odds96 is committed to preventing underage access to and irresponsible use of the games on this Website, whilst providing a supportive and fun gaming experience for its clients. While for most clients gambling does not cause any problems, a small percentage of clients may be susceptible to addiction. We take this matter very seriously and suggest that all of our clients take a short self-assessment questionnaire aimed at preventing gambling addiction.

Preventing gambling addiction:
1.  Are you seriously involved in gambling?
2.  Have you lost interest in your family, friends or hobbies due to gambling?
3.  Do you borrow money to gamble?
4.  Are you able to control the amount of time you spend on gambling?
5.  Is gambling having a negative effect on your reputation?
6.  Do you become irritable or aggressive when you gamble?
7.  Do you see gambling as a way to escape from your problems?
8.  After losing, do you feel the need to try to win back your losses straight away?
9.  Do you ever argue with friends or loved ones because of gambling?
10. Do you consider gambling to be a source of income?

If you have any concerns about your gambling habits, we urge you to seek for advice from the following accredited organizations:
